# CS4641 Project Proposal: Flight Delay Predictor

## Introduction/Background
There are no commercially available products that fulfill a similar purpose. There are existing sites, like https://wingman.wtf/ and https://www.knowdelay.com/index.html that seemingly provide a similar service, but produce an errors when attempting to search for flights. There are several scholarly articles that detail how machine learning could aid in predicting flight delays.
We plan on using datasets containing data on previous flights and their predicted vs. actual departure times at various airports in various regions/climates, which airline it's operated by, the number of people on each flight (including number of seats oversold and number of passengers on standby), the weather of surrounding areas (eg. temperature, precipitation, fog), flight volumes at each airport, and aircraft type (eg. age, size).

## Problem Definition
Airline delays are a frustration for passengers, and there are few resources available to predict which routes, airlines, and/or airports commonly have the most delays. Our motivation is that travellers should have the knowledge of when delays are most likely to occur, so they can plan their travels accordingly when timing is tight. Such a resource can also be beneficial for airports to optimize their operations, and for airlines to provide more reliable information and improve customer satisfaction.
