# CS4641 Project Proposal: Flight Delay Predictor

## Introduction/Background
# Literature Review

# Dataset Description

## Problem Definition
Airline delays are a frustration for passengers, and there are few resources available to predict which routes, airlines, and/or airports commonly have the most delays. Our motivation is that travellers should have the knowledge of when delays are most likely to occur, so they can plan their travels accordingly when timing is tight. Such a resource can also be beneficial for airports to optimize their operations, and for airlines to provide more reliable information and improve customer satisfaction.
